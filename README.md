# Knight Travails

## Overview
Knight Travails is a project that showcases the ability of a knight chess piece to find the shortest path to a designated point on the chessboard using a visual interface. The project demonstrates the implementation of a breadth-first search algorithm to determine the optimal path for the knight.

## Features
- **Interactive Chessboard**: Click to create a knight at a starting position or generate one at a random location on the board.
- **Destination Selection**: After placing the knight, select the destination square to see the knight's journey.
- **Optimal Path Visualization**: Watch as the path is calculated and visually displayed on the board.

## How It Works
1. **Initialization**: Users can start by either selecting a specific square on the board to place the knight or by generating a random starting position.
2. **Setting the Destination**: By clicking the "end" button, users can then select an ending destination for the knight.
3. **Calculating the Path**: Once the start and end points are set, the algorithm calculates the shortest path using a breadth-first search approach, considering the unique movement abilities of a knight in chess.
4. **Visualization**: The path is then visually represented on the board, showing each step the knight takes.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML/CSS**: For the layout and styling of the web interface.
- **JavaScript**: For the interactive elements and implementing the algorithm logic.
